        <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
        <div>
            Hello! My name is Clover. I've lived with Andrew for many, many years.
            I've moved across the east coast from Vermont to Pennsylvania. This is my Website
            that is full of information and photos about myself, so browse around and check
            out my pages on the about me, gallery of photos, and submit a comment
            in the comments section!

        <h2>Diet changes</h2>
        <div>
            I've been experimenting with different foods lately. You see, my original food
            was my favorite thing ever, tuna. It was originally made in the USA and I loved it, but 
            recently the company outsourced their manufacturing to Thailand, and ever since then, I 
            hate the food! There's something different about it. I browsed online and saw
            many others with the same complaints.

        <h2>Hope for the future?</h2>
        <div>
            After trying many different brands of new food, even the fancy ones, I still wasn't 
            satisfied with the offerings of tuna. However, my grandmother found a can of wild-caught
            salmon from Target and, even though it was a store brand, I absolutely loved it. Now I can't
            get enough, and every morning, I bug Andrew for my half can of salmon! Thank god! I thought
            I was never going to find food for me again!
